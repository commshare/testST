This is my fork of the state-threads library from http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/

Changes include:
- CMake build system
- Valgrind support for stack swaps
- Minor updates for modern C compilers (gcc/clang)
- pthread support (using __thread gcc extension)

See README.orig for more information.
